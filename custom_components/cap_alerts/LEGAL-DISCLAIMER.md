# CAP Alerts (Multi‑Feed) — Legal Disclaimer

Because this repository provides code related to emergency management agencies and emergency information, we must take a moment to provide appropriate disclaimers, so you are fully aware and informed of the risk and liabilities you accept when using repository or all or any part of code contained within, to ensure any party involved is appropriately protected.

We've done our best to make this human readable, so you can be fully aware of and informed of the obvious risks you accept using such an integration.

> [!WARNING]
> **IMPORTANT — NOT AN OFFICIAL WARNING SYSTEM.**
> This integration is **not** an official emergency information source and **must not** be relied upon as your sole or primary source of warnings. Always monitor and act on **official emergency communications** from your relevant authorities. **Use at your own risk.**

## Disclaimer

### 1) No support, no duty, no service

This project is **free software** released under **GPL‑3.0**. It is provided **without charge**, **without any service contract**, **without support**, and **without any undertaking** to update, maintain, monitor, host, or keep it available. **No duty of care** or other obligation is assumed by maintainers, contributors, or affiliated parties.

### 2) Disclaimer of warranty (GPL‑consistent)

**THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON‑INFRINGEMENT, ACCURACY, OR THAT THE SOFTWARE OR ITS OUTPUTS WILL BE ERROR‑FREE OR TIMELY.**

> This clause is consistent with and **supplementary to GPL‑3.0 sections 15–16** (Disclaimer of Warranty; Limitation of Liability). In case of any conflict, the **GPL‑3.0 text governs** for licensed code.

### 3) Limitation of liability (maximum extent permitted by law)

To the **maximum extent permitted by law**, the authors, maintainers, contributors, and any project participants **shall not be liable** for any damages including but not limited to **direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages**, or for any **loss of profits, revenues, business, data, goodwill, or opportunity** or similar loss, arising from or related to use of, misuse of, inability to use, reliance upon, or performance of the software, whether based in contract, tort (including **negligence**), strict liability, or any other theory—even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

> **Safety carve‑out (jurisdictional).** Some laws **do not allow** the exclusion or limitation of certain liabilities (for example, in England \& Wales and certain other jurisdictions, **liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence cannot be excluded**). Where a limitation above would be unlawful, it is **modified only to the minimum extent necessary** to comply with that law, and all remaining limitations continue to apply.

### 4) Assumption of risk \& user responsibility (primary‑source requirement)

By downloading, installing, enabling, configuring, testing, or using this software (including forks), **you accept and assume all risks** arising from its installation and operation. **You are solely responsible** for:

- independently monitoring and acting upon **official emergency information**,
- selecting, configuring, testing, validating, and maintaining your hardware, network, Home Assistant environment, and automations,
- providing independent fallbacks and safeguards appropriate to the risks you face, and
- verifying the correctness, timeliness, and fitness of any feeds, outputs, or triggers before relying on them.

If you implement this software, **correctly or incorrectly**, fail to maintain it, fail to verify data against official sources, or you or other parties connected with your use of the repository and/or code in whole or in part, suffer any harm (including but not limited to personal injury, death, misadventure, property damage, economic loss, or other consequences) **you agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that is your responsibility and not that of the authors, maintainers, contributors, GitHub, Microsoft, Nabu Casa/Home Assistant, HACS, any search engine, your power company, ISP, cloud provider, hardware or sensor vendor, or any other third party referenced in connection - either authorised or unauthorised - with this project.**

### 5) Third‑party data and services

This project **parses and normalizes third‑party feeds** (e.g., CAP/ATOM/JSON). Those sources may be **inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, rate‑limited, reformatted, or unavailable**. Parsing is **best‑effort** and subject to change without notice. **No warranty** is given regarding third‑party content, endpoints, or uptime.

### 6) No reliance; independent verification

You acknowledge that **no statement** in this repository or its documentation is a promise that can be relied upon for safety‑critical decisions. You must **independently verify** any output before acting and **maintain separate, official channels** for emergency information at all times.

### 7) Indemnity (hold harmless)

To the **maximum extent permitted by law**, you and any parties connected with your use of this repository or any code within **agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless** the authors, maintainers, contributors, and all **third parties** — but not expressly limited including **Emergency Management Agencies as feed providers, GitHub, Inc.; Microsoft Corporation; Nabu Casa, Inc.; HACS.xyz; any feed publisher; any cloud, hosting, or CDN provider; any ISP; and any hardware, sensor or device vendors referenced in examples or used in your instance or intergrations** — from and against **all claims, demands, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees)** arising out of or related to:

- (a) your use, misuse, or inability to use the software;
- (b) your configuration or failure to configure appropriate safeguards;
- (c) your failure to monitor and act on **official emergency sources**; or
- (d) your violation of applicable law or third‑party rights.

### 8) Formation and assent (open‑source license; assent recommended)

Distribution and use are governed by **GPL‑3.0**. Courts routinely enforce license terms and online notices where users receive **reasonably conspicuous notice** and provide **affirmative assent** (e.g., a checkbox or equivalent). To enhance clarity, the project may present a short notice and require **affirmative acceptance** during setup; you agree that such acceptance, when used, **forms a binding agreement** regarding these terms to the extent permitted by law.

### 9) Severability and non‑waiver

If any provision of this notice is found invalid or unenforceable, it will be **enforced to the maximum lawful extent** and the remainder will remain in full force and effect. Failure to enforce any provision is **not a waiver**.
